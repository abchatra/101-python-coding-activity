  ## Introduction


  Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the
  list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong
  order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The
  algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "some other sort" to the top
  of the list.


  ## Problem Statement


  Implement the bubble sort algorithm in Python. The function should take a list
  of integers as input and return a new list with the integers sorted in
  ascending order. The algorithm should repeatedly compare adjacent elements and
  swap them if they are in the wrong order, continuing this process until the
  list is sorted.


  ## Tests


  To ensure the bubble sort implementation is correct, consider the following
  test cases:


  1. **Test Case 1:**
     * Input: `[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]`
     * Expected Output: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`

  2. **Test Case 2:**
     * Input: `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`
     * Expected Output: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`

  3. **Test Case 3:**
     * Input: `[3, 0, -1, 8, 7, 2]`
     * Input Output: `[-1, 0, 2, 3, 7, 8]`

  4. **Test Case 4:**
     * Input: `[]` (an empty list)
     * Expected Output: `[]`

  5. **Test Case 5:**
     * Input: `[1]` (a single-element list)
     * Expected Output: `[1]`

  Make sure to test the function with these cases to verify its correctness.
