  # Multiplication Table


  ## Introduction


  Multiplication tables are a fundamental concept in mathematics and are
  commonly used to learn multiplication and arithmetic. In programming, creating
  a multiplication table is a simple exercise that helps beginners practice
  loops and output formatting.


  ## Problem Statement


  Write a Python program that prints the multiplication table for a given number
  up to 10 multiples.


  ## Explanation


  The program should:


  * Accept a number as input.

  * Print the multiplication table from 1 to 10 for that number in a clear
  format.

  * Each line should show the multiplication step, for example: `5 x 3 = 15`.


  ## Function Signature


  ```

  def print_multiplication_table(number):

  ```


  ## Example Test Cases


  ### Test Case 1:


  **Input:**


  ```

  print_multiplication_table(5)

  ```


  **Output:**


  ```

  5 x 1 = 5

  5 x 2 = 10

  5 x 3 = 15

  5 x 4 = 20

  5 x 5 = 25

  5 x 6 = 30

  5 x 7 = 35

  5 x 8 = 40

  5 x 9 = 45

  5 x 10 = 50

  ```


  ### Test Case 2:


  **Input:**


  ```

  print_multiplication_table(3)

  ```


  **Output:**


  ```

  3 x 1 = 3

  3 x 2 = 6

  3 x 3 = 9

  3 x 4 = 12

  3 x 5 = 15

  3 x 6 = 18

  3 x 7 = 21

  3 x 8 = 24

  3 x 9 = 27

  3 x 10 = 30

  ```


  ## Constraints


  * The number will be a positive integer.

  * The number will not exceed 1000.


  ## Hint


  Use a loop that runs from 1 to 10 and multiply the given number by the loop
  variable in each iteration.


  ## Challenges


  * Modify the program to print the table up to `n` multiples, where `n` is also
  an input.

  * Try formatting the output using string formatting techniques (f-strings or
  `format()` function).

  * Enhance the program to generate multiplication tables for a range of numbers
  instead of just one.
