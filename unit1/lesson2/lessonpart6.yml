title: Sum of the digits
content: >
  ## Introduction


  In this exercise, you will write a Python program to calculate the sum of the
  digits of a given number. This problem will help you practice using loops and
  conditionals, which are fundamental concepts in programming.


  ## Problem Statement


  Write a program that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the sum
  of its digits. For example, if the input is `123`, the output should be `6`
  because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.


  ## Explanation


  To solve this problem, you will need to repeatedly extract the last digit of
  the number and add it to a running total. You can achieve this by using the
  modulus operator `%` to get the last digit and integer division `/` to remove
  the last digit from the number. Continue this process until the number is
  reduced to zero.


  ## Function Signature


  ```python

  def sum_of_digits(n):

  ```


  ## Example Test Cases


  * **Test Case 1**:\
    Input: `123`\
    Output: `6`

  * **Test Case 2**:\
    Input: `0`\
    Output: `0`

  * **Test Case 3**:\
    Input: `4567`\
    Output: `22`

  ## Constraints


  * The input number `n` will be a non-negative integer.


  ## Hint


  Consider using a loop to iterate through each digit of the number. Use the
  modulus operator to extract the last digit and integer division to remove it
  from the number.


  ## Challenges


  Try to solve the problem without converting the number to a string. This will
  help you practice working with numerical operations and loops.
