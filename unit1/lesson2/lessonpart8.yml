title: Divisible 5
content: >+
  ## Introduction


  In this exercise, you will practice using loops and conditionals in Python to
  solve a common problem: finding numbers divisible by a specific value within a
  given range. This task will help you understand how to iterate over a range of
  numbers and apply conditional logic to filter results.


  ## Problem Statement


  Write a Python program that displays all numbers divisible by 5 within a
  specified range. The program should take two inputs: the start and end of the
  range, and output all numbers within this range that are divisible by 5.


  ## Explanation


  To solve this problem, you will need to use a loop to iterate through each
  number in the specified range. For each number, you will use a conditional
  statement to check if it is divisible by 5. If it is, you will print the
  number.


  ## Function Signature


  ```python

  def find_divisible_by_5(start, end):
      pass
  ```


  ## Example Test Cases


  * **Test Case 1:**

    * Input: `start = 1`, `end = 20`

    * Output: `5, 10, 15, 20`

  * **Test Case 2:**

    * Input: `start = 10`, `end = 30`

    * Output: `10, 15, 20, 25, 30`

  ## Constraints


  * The start and end values will be integers.


  * The start value will always be less than or equal to the end value.


  ## Hint


  Use the modulus operator `%` to determine if a number is divisible by 5. A
  number `n` is divisible by 5 if `n % 5 == 0`.


  ## Challenges


  * Modify the program to allow the user to specify any divisor, not just 5.


  * Extend the program to return the results as a list instead of printing them,
  which can be useful for further processing or testing.
