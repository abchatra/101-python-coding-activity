  # &#x20;Prime Numbers Within a Given Range


  ## Introduction


  Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1
  and themselves. They play a key role in number theory and cryptography. This
  exercise helps in understanding loops, conditions, and number checking logic.


  ## Problem Statement


  Write a Python program that prints all prime numbers within a given inclusive
  range.


  ## Explanation


  The program should:


  * Take two integers as input: start and end of the range.


  * Check each number in that range to determine if it is a prime.


  * Print all the prime numbers found within the range.


  ## Function Signature


  ```

  def print_primes_in_range(start, end):

  ```


  ## Example Test Cases


  ### Test Case 1:


  **Input:**


  ```

  print_primes_in_range(10, 20)

  ```


  **Output:**


  ```

  11

  13

  17

  19


  ```


  ### Test Case 2:


  **Input:**


  ```

  print_primes_in_range(1, 10)

  ```


  **Output:**


  ```

  2

  3

  5

  7


  ```


  ## Constraints


  * `start` and `end` will be positive integers.


  * `start` will be less than or equal to `end`.


  * The range will not exceed 10,000.


  ## Hint


  * A number is prime if it is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square
  root of the number.


  * You can use a nested loop or a helper function to check if a number is
  prime.


  ## Challenges


  * Optimize the prime-checking function to reduce computation time for large
  ranges.


  * Modify the program to return the list of primes instead of printing them.


  * Enhance the program to count and display the total number of primes found in
  the range.
