title: Reverse a number
content: >+
  ## Introduction


  In this exercise, you will write a Python program to reverse a given number.
  This problem will help you practice using loops and conditionals, which are
  fundamental concepts in programming.


  ## Problem Statement


  Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and returns the integer
  with its digits reversed. For example, if the input is `1234`, the output
  should be `4321`.


  ## Explanation


  Reversing a number involves extracting its digits and rearranging them in
  reverse order. You can achieve this by repeatedly extracting the last digit of
  the number and appending it to a new number until the original number is
  reduced to zero.


  ## Function Signature


  ```python

  def reverse_number(n):
      pass
  ```


  ## Example Test Cases


  * **Test Case 1:**

    * Input: `1234`

    * Output: `4321`

  * **Test Case 2:**

    * Input: `-5678`

    * Output: `-8765`

  * **Test Case 3:**

    * Input: `1000`

    * Output: `1`

  ## Constraints


  * The input number can be positive or negative.


  * The input number can have leading zeros, which should be ignored in the
  output.


  ## Hint


  Consider using a loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of the number using
  the modulus operator and build the reversed number by multiplying the current
  reversed number by 10 and adding the extracted digit.


  ## Challenges


  * Handle negative numbers correctly by preserving the negative sign in the
  reversed number.


  * Ensure that leading zeros in the input do not appear in the output.
