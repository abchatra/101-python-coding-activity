  # Count the Number of Vowels in a String


  ## &#x20;Introduction


  Vowels are an essential part of the English alphabet, consisting of the
  letters *A, E, I, O, U*Â (both uppercase and lowercase). In this problem, we
  will write a Python function to count the number of vowels in a given string.


  ## Problem Statement


  Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the count of
  vowels present in the string. The function should be case-insensitive, meaning
  it should count both uppercase and lowercase vowels.


  ## &#x20;Explanation


  To solve this problem, follow these steps:


  1\. Define a function that takes a string as input.


  2\. Convert the string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.


  3\. Iterate through the string and count occurrences of vowels (\`a, e, i, o,
  u\`).


  4\. Return the total count of vowels.


  ## &#x20;Function Signature


  ```

  def count_vowels(s)

  ```




  ## Example Test Cases


  ### &#x20;Input:


  ```

  print(count_vowels("Hello World"))


  print(count_vowels("Python Programming"))


  print(count_vowels("AEIOUaeiou"))


  print(count_vowels("xyz"))

  ```


  ### &#x20;Output:


  3


  5


  10


  0


  ## Constraints


  1\. The function should handle both uppercase and lowercase vowels.


  2\. The input string can contain alphabets, numbers, and special characters.


  3\. The input string length can be up to \`10^5\` characters.


  ## Hint


  * Use a set of vowels (\`{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}\`) for quick lookup.

  * Convert the string to lowercase using \`.lower()\` to simplify the
  comparison.

  * You can use list comprehension or the \`sum()\` function for a concise
  solution.


  ## Challenges


  1\. Modify the function to count and return the occurrences of each vowel
  separately.


  2\. Optimize the function to process large strings efficiently.


  3\. Extend the function to count vowels in multiple words or a paragraph.




  This problem helps in understanding string traversal, conditionals, and
  counting operations in Python.
