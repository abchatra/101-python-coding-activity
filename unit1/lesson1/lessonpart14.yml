  # Print Prime Numbers Between 1 and 100


  ## &#x20;Introduction


  Prime numbers are numbers that are greater than 1 and have only two factors:
  \*\*1 and itself\*\*. The first few prime numbers are \*\*2, 3, 5, 7, 11,
  ...\*\*. In this problem, we will write a Python program to print all prime
  numbers between \*\*1 and 100\*\*.


  ## &#x20;Problem Statement


  Write a Python function that prints all prime numbers between \*\*1 and
  100\*\*.


  ## &#x20;Explanation


  To solve this problem, follow these steps:


  1\. Define a function to check if a number is prime.


  2\. Loop through numbers from \*\*1 to 100\*\*.


  3\. For each number, check if it is prime.


  4\. If the number is prime, print it.


  ## &#x20;Function Signature


  ```

  def print_primes(number):

  ```


  ## &#x20;


  ### &#x20;


  ### Input:


  ```

  print_primes(100)

  ```


  ### Output:


  2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97


  ## Constraints


  1\. The function should print prime numbers between **1 and 100**.


  2\. The function should use an efficient method to check for prime numbers.


  ## &#x20;Hint


  * A prime number is \*\*only divisible by 1 and itself\*\*.


  - Use a loop to check divisibility up to \`√n\` (square root of \`n\`) for
  optimization.


  ## &#x20;Challenges


  1\. Modify the function to find prime numbers in any given range \`(start,
  end)\`.


  2\. Optimize the function using **Sieve of Eratosthenes** for better
  performance.


  3\. Implement the function using recursion instead of loops.




  This problem helps in understanding loops, conditional statements, and number
  theory concepts in Python.
