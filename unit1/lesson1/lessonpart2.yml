title: Check if number is even or odd
content: >
  #### **Introduction**


  In this puzzle, you will write a program that determines whether a given
  number is **even** or **odd**. This is a fundamental programming task that
  helps build logical thinking and understanding of numerical properties.


  #### **Problem Statement**


  Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns whether the number
  is **"Even"** or **"Odd"**. Your function should check if the number is
  divisible by 2 and return the appropriate result.


  #### **Explanation**


  A number is considered:


  * **Even** if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`).

  * **Odd** if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`).


  For example:


  * **4** is even because `4 % 2 == 0`

  * **7** is odd because `7 % 2 == 1`


  Your task is to implement a function that determines if a given number is even
  or odd.


  #### **Function Signature**


  ```

  def check_even_odd(number: int) -> str: # Your code here

  ```


  #### **Example Test Cases**


  | Input | Output |

  | :---- | :----- |

  | 10    | "Even" |

  | 3     | "Odd"  |

  | 0     | "Even" |

  | -7    | "Odd"  |

  | -2    | "Even" |


  #### **Constraints**


  * The input will always be an integer.

  * The number can be positive, negative, or zero.


  #### **Hint**


  Use the modulus operator `%` to determine if a number is divisible by 2.


  #### **Challenge**


  Try to solve this problem using as few lines of code as possible!


  Good luck! ðŸš€
