  # Python Program to Add Two Numbers


  ## Introduction


  Adding two numbers is one of the simplest and most fundamental programming
  tasks. This program is designed to take two inputs from the user, add them
  together, and print the result. This basic operation is foundational in
  learning programming and understanding data manipulation.


  ## Program


  ```python

  def add_two_numbers(a, b):
      return a + b

  # User input

  num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

  num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))


  # Function call

  result = add_two_numbers(num1, num2)


  # Display the result

  print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}")

  ```


  ## Explanation


  1. **Function Creation**: The `add_two_numbers(a, b)` function is created to
  take two arguments, `a` and `b`, and return their sum. This encapsulates the
  addition logic and makes it reusable.

  2. **Input Handling**: The `input()` function is used to take user input, and
  it is converted to `float` to allow for decimal numbers as well as integers.

  3. **Function Call and Result Display**: The input values are passed to the
  `add_two_numbers` function, and the result is printed.


  ## Test Cases


  ### Test Case 1

  **Input**:

  ```

  Enter the first number: 5

  Enter the second number: 3

  ```

  **Output**:

  ```

  The sum of 5.0 and 3.0 is: 8.0

  ```


  ### Test Case 2

  **Input**:

  ```

  Enter the first number: -2.5

  Enter the second number: 4.5

  ```

  **Output**:

  ```

  The sum of -2.5 and 4.5 is: 2.0

  ```


  ### Test Case 3

  **Input**:

  ```

  Enter the first number: 0

  Enter the second number: 0

  ```

  **Output**:

  ```

  The sum of 0.0 and 0.0 is: 0.0

  ```


  ### Test Case 4

  **Input**:

  ```

  Enter the first number: 123456789

  Enter the second number: 987654321

  ```

  **Output**:

  ```

  The sum of 123456789.0 and 987654321.0 is: 1111111110.0
