  ### Problem Statement


  Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list
  containing only the prime numbers from the original list. A prime number is a
  natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and
  itself.


  ### Explanation


  To solve this problem, you need to iterate through the list of integers and
  check each number to determine if it is prime. If a number is prime, add it to
  the new list. The function should return this new list of prime numbers.


  ### Example Test Cases


  **Test Case 1:**


  Input: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`


  Output: `[2, 3, 5, 7]`


  **Test Case 2:**


  Input: `[11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]`


  Output: `[11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]`


  ### Constraints


  * The input list can contain up to 1000 integers.


  * Each integer in the list is between 1 and 10,000.


  ### Hints


  1. A simple way to check if a number is prime is to try dividing it by all
  numbers from 2 to the square root of the number.

  2. Remember that 2 is the only even prime number.


  ### Potential Challenges


  * Consider the efficiency of your solution, especially for large numbers.


  * Think about edge cases, such as lists with no prime numbers or lists with
  only one element.
